1). When you think about loop also think about updating the things which can be reused in loop
2). pow() - O(log n) 
3). iterative approach is better than recursion
4). log10(n) - for count digits   ---   log2(n) - for no. of bits needed
5). O(min(a,b)) is equal or always better then O(b)
6). Never push back anything into array or string in if else statement it only executes for particular condition
7). For an unsigned int the loop for 32 times
8). n with k bits runs O(log2n) times
9). memoization is an optimization technique used prmiarly in recursive algorithms to store the result and reuse the resutlt when same inputs occur again 
10). After writing brute force think about how you can reduce step or search for what is repeating in each times.
11). prefix sum array can be converted into sum[i] += sum[i+1]
12). no. of iteration in while loop is depends on the number of digits of n not the actual value of n
13). 5 steps Dsa poblem - i). understand the problem  ii). Look for patterns  iii). Decide an approach  iv). test edge case - 0,normal,large  v).Optimise How you can avoid unecessary computaions
14). memoization is process of storing and recalling information from memory.
15). When there is {Options --> Recursion(Tree Diagram)}
16). *The maximum number of operations generally allowed before hitting a timeout is about 10 to 20 million
17). for for loop ,, ask to ownself where it starts , when it ends, how it goes
