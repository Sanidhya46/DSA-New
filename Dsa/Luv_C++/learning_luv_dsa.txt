1). Segementation fault - you want to acess that memory which is never allocated.
2). If you do not declare size of array through error.
3). local array are stored in stack of size of 8 mb 10^5, and global array declare in data segment 
4). Returs ends the execution of function
5). Pass by value only sends copy of value , but for refrences it completely change the value in other function
6). In c pointer is used for referene but in c++ we using & empersand.
7). swap(a, b) returns void cout expects to displaying integer values.
8). arrays never passed by pass by value always passed by pass by reference.
9). declare array globally to away from passing in function.
10). Declare array globally good for competitive programming but not for software developer
11). you can prevent stack overflow by heap memory.
