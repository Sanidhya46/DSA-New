1). If an recursive algorithm repeteadly solves the same problem then it is overlapping subproblems
2). optimal substructure solution of the given problem can be obtained using optimal solution of its sub problems.
3). divide and conquer, the problem is divided into smaller non overlapping sub problems and an optimal solution for each subproblem
